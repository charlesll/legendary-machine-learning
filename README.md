Tutorials and tests of algorithms in Python (Keras/Tensorflow/Scikit-Learn) and Julia (Flux.jl and scratch)

This repo hosts Jupyter Notebooks with examples, tutorials and tests of machine learning algorithms and differentiable programmation related to my trials and research.

It will be populated depending on the tests I do, results I get as well as free time.

# Test of the size/sparsity of dataset : deep or shallow networks?

The notebooks Test_MLSize***.ipynb are test of using deep or shallow networks for regression
over sparse, small datasets (synthetic)

# Combining neural network with equations

The notebook(s) ML_plusEquations***.ipynb contain examples of using custom networks with equations.
