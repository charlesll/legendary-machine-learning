Tutorials and tests of algorithms in Python (Keras/Tensorflow/Scikit-Learn) and Julia (Flux.jl and scratch)

This repo hosts Jupyter Notebooks with examples, tutorials and tests of machine learning algorithms and differentiable programmation related to my trials and research.

Feel free to send corrections/contributions/suggestions !

It will be populated depending on the tests I do, results I get as well as free time.
